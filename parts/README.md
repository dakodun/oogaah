The files in this folder are individual chunks of javascript seperated for easier management and understanding. The files here have
already been concatenated into the "main.js" file in the parent directory.

The files in this folder relate to the base engine (which is being simultaneously developed alongside the game): 
main.js is the main entry point into the engine; initscene.js is the main entry point into game specific related code
